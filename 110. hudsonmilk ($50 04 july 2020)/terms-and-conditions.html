                  <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
                  <p>At HUDSON MILK Limited ("HUDSON MILK"), we respect the privacy needs of our customers and users.
                     This Privacy Policy outlines what specific information is gathered on the web site under the domain
                     name hudsonmilk.com (the "Site") and how that information is used.</p>
                  <p>Maintaining the privacy of your information is of paramount importance to us as it helps foster
                     confidence, goodwill and stronger relationships with you, our customers. If, at any time, you have
                     questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please feel free contact us via email to
                     info@hudsonmilk.com. The Site is not intended for use by persons under the age of eighteen.
                     Individuals who are under eighteen are expressly prohibited from posting any personally
                     identifiable information about themselves</p>
                  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
                  <p>Hudson Milk explicitly asks when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal
                     Information"). Your Personal Information is used to create your personal user account. Contact
                     information and other user-specific information is used only internally by Hudson Milk to operate
                     the Site and to communicate with users of the Site ("Users"). Demographic and profile data
                     collected by Hudson Milk may be used to tailor this Site or any requested email communications, and
                     to display information that is more relevant to you. Hudson Milk also compiles demographic and
                     product use information, but in the aggregate only, and may make that aggregate information
                     publicly available. Information relating to User transactions, such as contact information,
                     transaction type, transaction amount, payment, shipping and billing information, are used
                     internally by Hudson Milk and are not disclosed to third parties. Hudson Milk may use a User's
                     contact information to communicate with the User regarding product and service updates, patches,
                     policy changes, billing and other activities relating to the use of the Site, and for marketing
                     purposes.</p>
                  <p>Hudson Milk reserves the right to disclose any information if such action is necessary (a) to
                     conform to the requirements of law or to comply with legal process or notice served on Hudson Milk,
                     (b) to protect and defend the legal rights or property of Hudson Milk, the Site or its Users, or
                     (c) in an emergency, to protect the health and safety of its Users or the general public. Hudson
                     Milk further reserves the right to release any information concerning any User if that User
                     participates (or is reasonably suspected of participating) in any illegal activity, even without a
                     notice, warrant, or other court order. Finally, Hudson Milk reserves the right to cooperate with
                     law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or services for illegal
                     activities, and to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement agencies for
                     investigation or prosecution.</p>
                  <p>Your email address is used to only send you information that you have requested. As part of your
                     use of the Site, Hudson Milk allows you to elect to receive, or not receive, certain information
                     from Hudson Milk. Hudson Milk adheres strictly to permission-based email policy. Except where
                     requested, Hudson Milk will not send you unsolicited email information, commercial offers or
                     advertisements. Hudson Milk will not sell, rent, or loan our contact lists (including customer
                     data) to any outside firms. All emails that you have requested will have an option to unsubscribe.
                     Hudson Milk will fulfill unsubscribe requests quickly so that no further communications are sent to
                     Users who have stated that they do not wish to receive the specified information. From time to time
                     we may need to contact you to advise on alterations to the Site and/or updates to this or other
                     policies.</p>

                  <h2>Special Offers and Updates</h2>
                  <p>We send all new Users a welcoming email to confirm their password and username. A follow up email
                     will be sent to new users explaining in detail how the service works. Established Users will
                     occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of
                     respect for the privacy of our Users we present the option to not receive these types of
                     communications. Customers can unsubscribe via the unsubscribe mechanism at the bottom of each
                     email.</p>
                  <h2>Newsletter</h2>
                  <p>If a User wishes to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we ask for contact information such as name and

                     communications via the unsubscribe mechanism at the bottom of each email or by sending an email
                     with the Users name and "Opt-Out" in the message.</p>
                  <h2>Customer Service</h2>
                  <p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues
                     relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes.</p>
                  <h2>Website Usage Information</h2>
                  <p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site. We do
                     not link your IP address to any personally identifiable information. We use tracking information to
                     determine which areas our site users visit based on traffic to those areas. Hudson Milk does not
                     track what individual users read, but rather how often each page is visited. This helps us maintain
                     a superior and informative website for you.</p>
                  <p>Our store is hosted on DeliveryBizPro.com. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that
                     allows us to sell our products and services to you.</p>

                  <h2>Payment:</h2>
                  <p>DeliveryBizPro.com stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry
                     Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is
                     necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction
                     information is deleted.</p>
                  <p>All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security
                     Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
                     Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our
                     store and its service providers.</p>
                  <h2>Security</h2>
                  <p>To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best
                     practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or
                     destroyed.</p>
                  <p>If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure
                     socket layer technology (SSL). Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic
                     storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally
                     accepted industry standards.</p>

                  <h2>Do we use 'cookies'?</h2>
                  <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard
                     drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems
                     to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use
                     cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help
                     us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to
                     provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about
                     site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the
                     future.</p>
                  <h2>We use cookies to:</h2>
                  <p>● Help remember and process the items in the shopping cart.<br>● Understand and save user's
                     preferences for future visits.<br>● Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions
                     in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted
                     third-party services that track this information on our behalf.</p>
                  <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose
                     to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since browser is a little
                     different, look at your browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>
                  <p>If you turn cookies off, Some of the features that make your site experience more efficient may not
                     function properly. It may also cause transactions to not process.</p>
                  <h2>Third-party disclosure</h2>
                  <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable
                     Information.</p>
                  <h2>Third-party links</h2>
                  <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our
                     website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have
                     no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless,
                     we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>
                  <h2>Google</h2>
                  <p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put
                     in place to provide a positive experience for users.

                  <p>We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.</p>
                  <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
                  <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to
                     post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or
                     company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
                     Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy
                     on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies
                     with whom it is being shared. - See more at:
                     http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>
                  <h2>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h2>
                  <p>Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it
                     on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website. Our
                     Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified
                     above.</p>
                  <p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:<br>● On our Privacy Policy Page<br>Can change
                     your personal information:<br>● By emailing us<br>● By calling us<br>● By logging in to your
                     account</p>
                  <h2>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h2>
                  <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not
                     Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>
                  <h2>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h2>
                  <p>It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>
                  <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
                  <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years
                     old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal
                     Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells
                     out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety
                     online.</p>
                  <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>
                  <h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>
                  <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and
                     the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws
                     around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be
                     implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
                  </p>
                  <h2>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
                     action, should a data breach occur:</h2>
                  <p>We will notify you via email<br>● Within 1 business day<br>We will notify the users via in-site
                     notification<br>● Within 1 business day</p>
                  <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to
                     legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
                     law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users,
                     but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or
                     prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
                  <h2>CAN SPAM Act</h2>
                  <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for
                     commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and
                     spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
                  <h2>We collect your email address in order to:</h2>
                  <p>● Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions<br>● Process orders
                     and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.<br>● Send you additional information
                     related to your product and/or service<br>● Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails
                     to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.</p>
                  <h2>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</h2>
                  <p>● Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.<br>● Identify the message as an
                     advertisement in some reasonable way.<br>● Include the physical address of our business or site
                     headquarters.<br>● Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is
                     used.<br>● Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.<br>● Allow users to unsubscribe by using the
                     link at the bottom of each email.</p>
                  <h2>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at
                  </h2>
                  <p>info@hudsonmilk.com and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</p>

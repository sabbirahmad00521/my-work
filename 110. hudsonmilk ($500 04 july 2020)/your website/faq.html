                        Why does milk in a supermarket, including organic milk, have a longer shelf life?

                        <p>The majority of milk found in supermarkets, including organic brands, is often not produced
                           locally and has to travel further to reach you. In order to make sure the milk does not go
                           sour prior to making it to the supermarket shelf, it is Ultra-High Temperature pasteurized.
                           This pasteurization process will lengthen the shelf life, but this comes at the sacrifice of
                           quality and taste of the milk. Our milk is bottled directly on the farm using a minimal, low
                           temperature pasteurization and is delivered to us within 1-2 days of being bottled. It is
                           fresher, of better quality and tastes better than milk from the store!

                        <p>The milk we carry is not certified organic. The farms follow organic farming practices with
                           one small exception-antibiotics. The farms DO NO feed antibiotics to their animals, or use
                           antibiotics for prevention of illness. However, in rare instances they will use antibiotics
                           to treat a sick cow if no other course of action is available. The health of their herd is
                           their top priority. On organic farms, antibiotics are completely forbidden, meaning if a cow
                           gets sick they get sent to the slaughterhouse. Our farms believe in the humane treatment of
                           their herd, including antibiotics when necessary. When a cow is treated with antibiotics, she
                           is removed from the heard and her milk is dumped during the entire duration of treatment.
                           Once the cow is no longer being treated, her milk will be tested and dumped until which point
                           it tests completely clear from any trace amount of antibiotics.

                           occur on a weekly, biweekly or monthly basis; however there is no requirement to set up
                           recurring orders. You can also order on an as-needed basis. Once you determine your needs,
                           while not required, we do recommend you set up a recurring order. This helps us manage
                           inventory and also eliminates the need for you to log in every week to set up your orders.

                        <p>After your family has finished the delicious milk, we ask that you please rinse out all glass
                           bottles and place them in your cooler/milk box. Your driver will pick them up the next time
                           you have a delivery. The farms charge us a bottle deposit of $1.50 - $2.00 on each bottle.
                           Currently we do not pass this deposit on to our customers, however it is imperative that the
                           bottles are returned to us each week. The bottles are returned to the creamery where they are
                           then sterilized and reused.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you have a bottle that is cracked, chipped or broken, please do NOT return it but rather
                           place it in your neighborhood recycling bin.

                           easy as possible for our awesome products to find their way to your front door! If your
                           property may be difficult for a large truck to access, or if your property has a gate access
                           code, please alert us to this. If you have a dog or dogs, we do ask that they are not outside
                           during our delivery times. Also, if you think our truck may disturb your dog, please give us
                           a call so we can work out a solution--we do not want the dog to wake up the whole house when

                           to add new neighborhoods if there is enough interest. If there are at least 5-10 families
                           interested, let us know. And we'll give you a referral bonus! We would love the opportunity
                           to expand our delivery area and help connect even more families with the amazing farmers we

                           selecting the "Skip Deliveries" option. If you need to cancel delivery after the 10:00 AM
                           cutoff, please email <a href="mailto:info@hudsonmilk.com">info@hudsonmilk.com</a> or call the
                           office at 914-245-0409 and we would be happy to help you. If you are going out of town, you
                           can skip one or more weeks by using the "Skip Deliveries" option. Should you wish to cancel
                           all future deliveries (which we certainly hope will not happen!), simply log into your
                           account and remove any recurring order that you have set up. You can also call us at
                           914-245-0409 and we can cancel future deliveries for you. We will arrange for a final bottle
                           pick up to retrieve any remaining glass bottles you have.</p>

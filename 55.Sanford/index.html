               <p>A shared commitment to inspiring teaching and leadership brought together more than 50 education leaders from around the country to participate in the Sanford Inspire Leadership Summit on March 12-13 in San Diego. The goal of the two-day forum at the Sanford Education Center at National University was to advance initiatives designed to inspire Pre-K-12 students to succeed.</p>
               <p>A leadership panel launched the event with a lively discussion featuring panelists Dr. Judy Mantle, dean of the Sanford College of Education at National University; Dr. Joe Johnson, dean of the College of Education at San Diego State University; Eduardo Solorzano, director of instruction at Los Angeles Unifed School District; Eric Gurna, president and CEO of LA’s BEST, an organization that provides safe and supervised after school education, enrichment, and recreation programs; and Richard Ressel, director of Sanford Inspire at National University System.</p>
               <p>Among the topics discussed by the panelists included increasing engagement with parents, reaching diverse student audiences, and ensuring educators have access to ongoing professional development and resources that can lead to more inspiring teaching</p>
               <p>“An inspiring teacher is effective, energetic and enthusiastic,” said Dr. Judy Mantle. “They bring everything to life in the classroom and communicate clearly through words and actions that all students matter, and everyone is valued.”</p>
               <p>Eduardo Solorzano noted that inspiring teaching starts with understanding student needs: “We need to know who the students are, to understandtheir experiences and build that into their instruction, into the relationship building. We inspire so that they can aspire.”</p>
               <p>Eric Gurna noted that teachers beneft from ongoing support, not just tools: “We need to look at teacher education as self-development, not just providing tools to implement but creating conditions that allow them to have the experience of their imagination coming to life in their work.”</p>
               <p>Many of the Leadership Summit participants were members of the Sanford Education Collaborative, a group of 20 universities from around the country led by the National University System that are advancing two programs developed to support educators and student success: Sanford Harmony, a Pre-K-6 social emotional learning program, and Sanford Inspire, which provides access to research-based teaching methodologies and on-demand, self-guided online courses and video models designed to encourage inspiring classroom experiences</p>
               <p>The focus of the Sanford Inspire Leadership Summit was mostly on Sanford Inspire, though the two programs are aligned and support the development of the whole child. <a href="">Sanford Inspire</a> is based on the idea that every child should have not just one, but many inspiring teachers. The program is the vision of philanthropist T. Denny Sanford, who joined the Leadership Summit to chat and mingle with the educators.</p>
               <p>When asked what defnes an inspiring teacher, the panelists responded that a teacher’s highest priority is to establish positive connections with students through relationship building and caring. When educators create an environment where students feel valued, respected, and capable, it leads to a positive, transformational culture where teachers can build effective, engaging instruction that is essential to student success.</p>
               <p>In discussing the importance of creating conditions for student success, panelists talked about providing equal emphasis on creating conditions where teachers feel valued and supported. A vital part of training, recruiting, and retaining inspired teachers is developing a culture of collaboration. Teachers are the driving force of innovation in education, and by establishing open dialog within the community, objectives can be tailored to be more responsive to the needs of teachers</p>
               <p>During the Summit, Collaborative members shared how they are integrating Sanford Inspire principles into their schools of education or through professional development outreach. Examples were shared by: <a href="">National University</a> and <a href="">City University of Seattle </a>– both part of the <a href="">National University System</a>; <a href="">Long Island University and Nova Southeastern University</a>.</p>
               <p>Adding perspectives, the Leadership Summit featured a presentation by David Quilleon, sr. vice president, Global Mission, State Development and Operation of Best Buddies. Following a celebratory evening recognizing Sanford Inspire champions, the Leadership Summit concluded with small group breakout sessions for participants to share their perspectives on inspiring teaching. The Leadership Summit was organized by the Sanford Programs team at the National University System, which is led by Director Scott Page.</p>

               <h3>Collaborative University Spotlight</h3>
               <p>Long Island University and Nova Southeastern University held the frst ever Sanford Inspire Exchange on December 7-8 at the NSU campus. This collaboration included the New York City Department of Education, LIU, NSU, and Broward County Public Schools. The purpose of this event was to bring administrators and educators together to collaborate on school success. The NYCDOE was able to visit three schools in Broward County and learn about the accomplishments and challenges that each are seeing at their schools. The schools have adopted both Inspire and Harmony as part of their daily culture. Modules are used not only for professional development for the faculty and staff, but also to change the way they teach in order to create inspirational classrooms. Thank you to LIU and NSU for utting together an amazing event that allows for collaboration with key participants and is expanding the Sanford Inspire Mission.</p>

Hi, I wanted to know if you could convert this pdf to html today:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/dhdgg84nyu3k0v9/18-SINSP-0447_Newsletter%20Spring%202018_LP_CE-AS-Review.pdf?dl=0

I don't need the menu or footer done, but I do need the header part that says "Sanford Inspire Spring Newsletter". I don't need fonts or links (i'll do that later) but I will probably need inline styles on the table.

Can you send me a quote and timeline please?

Sure, I can add an extra $5 for a total of $25 if you can add the images and links that I'll provide. Sound good?


no, just use the image links that i provide so the links aren't external. Here are the links to the images:

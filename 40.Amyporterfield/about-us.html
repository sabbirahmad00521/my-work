               <p>Let me get this straight. When you first started out on your sports journey, you imagine the success and glory. You imagined achieving everything in sports with the medals to show for it. But your dreams have been stalled because you got stuck and realized you didn’t have the mental strength and know how the sports world entailed. You have tried over and over without any progress. At the same time you keep hearing different success stories around you. <br><br> <i>Why am I for you?</i></p>
               <p><b>BECAUSE</b>you’re a young athlete who is starting out on this journey into sports and needs guidance (I was once a young athlete)</p>
               <p><b>BECAUSE</b>you have trouble getting your mind to perform when you need it the most (I struggled with mental toughness issues myself and found a way to beat it)</p>
               <p><b>BECAUSE</b>you are sick and tired of hearing about your talent and potential and are ready to be the best athlete you can be. (I was once compared to the greatest footballer ever) <br>(I will give you an image here from a tweet about me you will put below this)</p>
               <p><b>BECAUSE</b>you struggle with your life outside sports.</p>

               <h2><i>AND ME?</i> THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT I DO</h2>
               <p>I get upset at how young athletes are left to fend for themselves. If they get to know fine if they don’t fine. Yes some are lucky while some are not. I fell into the category of the unlucky I had to find the solutions myself. That’s what makes me passionate about you. That’s what brought about Athlete Maestro. <br> <br>I do only two things and I do them really well. Its my gift. Try me.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p>I find your struggle points and put together a plan to get the best performance out of you. <br><br> From mental training tips to focus and concentration to strategies unique to athletes, I’ll have you churning out world class performances with the confidence of a world class athlete in no time. So whether you’re world class right now or not you never have that “lost” feeling again.<br><br> <b>BEST PART </b>I have tailor made content specifically for you and I make it easy.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>I teach you how to have a successful life outside of sports. That’s how I combine being a Lawyer, Entrepreneur and Performance Coach. Oh I’m also a sport analyst on radio. You can call me an <b>O.A.P.</b></p>

               <p>I’ll keep it simple and random, with these facts: </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p>I love sports, so even though I’m a Lawyer, sports is a big part of my life. I played sports right from the age of 5 and still do so today.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>I’m from Lagos, Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa, a country rich in sporting talent. (we won the Gold medal in Football at the Olympic games in 1996, yup!)</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>I won many awards in secondary school because of my sporting talent and I am super proud of them. So why didn’t I play sports professionally? Injury and lack of a proper plan.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>You see, I believed strongly in having a solid education that’s why I’m a Lawyer so it wasn’t until I finished school that I actively chased playing professional sports (big mistake, I should have started earlier even while chasing my education)</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>I tore my anterior cruciate ligament in my right knee just when I finished university that required surgery and a long rehabilitation. (I will provide you my surgery images to put here)</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>During my rehabilitation I studied successful athletes and came up with my blueprint to get back on my feet physically and mentally. Injuries are a b***h</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>Unfortunately by the time I was whole and hearty, I found it difficult to kickstart my career because of my age (I lost time to the injury) and dealing with fraudulent agents (can you imagine, the buggers wanted me to lie about my age)</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>But those blueprints were a live saver, and its what I teach you to get you producing results instantaneously</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>Remember I said I love sports? I LOVE IT! I love coaching young athlete, seeing the fire in their eyes, the big smile when they win a medal or a championship or sign their first pro contract. I love helping you avoid some of the mistake I made.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>By the way I always dreamed that when my playing days were over I would go into coaching. (see how fate works lool)</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>That’s what I hope to do for you here at Athlete Maestro…help you be the best athlete you can possibly be.</p>
                  </li>
               </ul>

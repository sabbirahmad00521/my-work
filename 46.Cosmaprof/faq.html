               <h2>FAQ</h2>
               <div class="content">
                  <h3>1.What are the steps involved in owning a cosmetics brand?</h3>
                  <h4>Steps in choosing your product:</h4>
                  <p>I) The brand owner will specify which markets they are interested in entering since products from each level are different (high-end, middle, low-end market). They will also specify the customer group that will be focused on such as teenagers, middle-aged people or elders. Lastly they will come up with a name for their product and brand. <br> II) Customers will be able to choose a suitable product for their target market based on our wide selection of standard cosmetic formulations (400+ formulations). As an option, customers can also ask us to come up with a formulation that will only be used for them (additional cost involved). <br> III) Once the customer has tried their selected products and are satisfied we can them move on to product registration.</p>
                  <h4>Steps in choosing packaging and product label design:</h4>
                  <p>I) Customers can purchase their own packaging material and send them to us or can use our purchasing service to procure packaging for them. In the case where the customer brings in their own packaging, we take no responsibility in items that may be damaged due to transport. <br> II) Customers can bring in their own boxes and product design or can hire us to design and print for them as well. In both cases, it is necessary for Cosmaprof to check that boxes and labels are in accordance with standards laid out by the Thai FDA.</p>
                  <h4>Steps in Manufacturing:</h4>
                  <p>I) Cosmaprof will specify the amount of time that is needed to manufacture your product (based on the complexity and steps involved) and set a date for you to receive your products. <br><br> II) Since Cosmaprof strictly follows regulations from the FDA regarding harmful and illegal additives in cosmetic products. Customers can rest assured that our products do not contain illegal ingredients and won’t be used to over claim on things that can’t be done.</p>

                  <h3>2.What are the steps required in product FDA registration?</h3>
                  <p>Cosmaprof can register your products with FDA on your behalf (given the customer provides us with the following) <br><br> I) Brand Name (in Thai and English) <br><br> II) Product Name (Thai and English), where the thai and english version of the names must match and follow the naming regulations set by the Thai FDA.</p>
                  <h3>3.What if I want a unique formulation just for my brand? Is this also possible?</h3>
                  <p>Yes. Cosmaprof has a service where we can formulate products just for your brand. They are normally done in one of two ways. <br><br> I) Customers can bring sample products which they are interested in or guide us to what are the benefits and properties that are desired from the products. Our lab will formulate a new formulation based on that information at 3,000 baht per product. <br><br> II) Once our customers are satisfied with the product samples given, Cosmaprof has a stability check service (free of charge) that will verify if the formulation is stable. This process can take up to 14 days and if completed can then be used in real production.</p>

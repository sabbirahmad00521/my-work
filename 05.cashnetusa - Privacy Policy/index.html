Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the Website analyze how users use the site. You can find out more about how Google uses data when you visit our Website by visiting “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps”, (located at <a href="#">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

For more information regarding Google Analytics please visit Google’s website, and pages that describe Google Analytics, such as <a href="#">www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a>. To learn more about interest-based advertisements and your opt-out rights and options, visit the <a href="#">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> and the <a href="#">Network Advertising Initiative</a> websites (<a href="#">www.aboutads.info</a> and <a href="#">www.networkadvertising.org</a>), or by clicking the “ad choices” icon by the advertisement and selecting what types of advertisement you wish to opt out of. Please note that if you choose to opt out, you may continue to see ads on our Website, but they will not be based on how you browse and shop.</p>
            <h6>Information Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies</h6>
            <p>We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website through your computer or mobile device. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the Website again, the cookie allows the Website to recognize your browser. Cookies may store unique identifiers, user preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Website features or services may not function properly without cookies. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, tracking user trends and providing relevant advertising to you. (See, “<a href="#">Advertising</a>” below.)</p>
            <h5>No Information From Children Under Age 13</h5>
            <p>If you are under the age of 13, please do not attempt to register with us at this Website or provide any personal information about yourself to us.

If you believe we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, please <a href="#">Contact Us</a> or call us at (888) 801-9075.</p>
            <h6>HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</h6>
            <p><b>To Provide Products, Services, and Information.</b>We collect information from you so that we can provide loan products and services that you apply for using the Website, provide information that you request from us, and setup your online account so you can manage your account on account details online. We use your personal information to contact you about your orders, underwrite your loan, fund your loan, make payments on your loan, and to setup your online account. We may send you information about our products and services, and new offerings.</p><br>
            <p><b>Credit Bureaus.</b>We may share your information about you and your account to credit bureaus. This may include both on-time and late payment, missed payment, or other defaults on your account, and this information may be reflected on your credit report.</p><br>
            <p><b>Sweepstakes, Surveys, Promotions, and Other Contests.</b>We use your personal information to administer surveys, sweepstakes, promotions and other contests from time to time.</p><br>
           <p> <b>Sharing with Third Parties.</b>We may provide information to third party service providers that help us operate and manage our Website. These service providers will have access to your personal information in order to provide these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service.</p>
            <p><b>Advertising.</b> We may use how you browse and shop in order to show you ads for CNU that are more relevant to your interests. We may use cookies and other information to provide relevant interest-based advertising to you. Interest-based ads are ads presented to you based on your browsing behavior in order to provide you with ads more tailored to your interests. These interest-based ads may be presented to you while you are browsing our site or third-party sites not owned by CNU.</p><br>
            <p>We belong to ad networks that may use your browsing history across participating websites to show you interest-based advertisements on those websites. Currently, our Website does not recognize if your browser sends a “do not track” signal or similar mechanism to indicate you do not wish to be tracked or receive interest-based ads. You can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from us by clicking on the “ad choices” icon near the advertisement and selecting the marketing activities you would like to opt-out of. To learn more about interest-based advertisements and your opt-out rights and options, visit the <a href="#">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> and the <a href="#">Network Advertising Initiative</a> websites (<a href="#">www.aboutads.info</a> and <a href="#">www.networkadvertising.org</a>), or by clicking the “ad choices” icon by the advertisement and selecting what types of advertisement you wish to opt out of. Please note that if you choose to opt out, you may continue to see ads on our Website, but they will not be based on how you browse and shop.</p><br>
            <p><b>Your Consent.</b> In addition to the sharing described elsewhere in this Policy, we will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of CNU when we have your consent to do so.</p><br>
           <p><b>Legal Proceedings. </b>We will share personal information with third party companies, organizations or individuals outside of CNU if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</li>
                <li>Enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations.</li>
                <li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>
                <li>Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of CNU, our users, customers or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p><b>Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.</b>If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business or the Website to a third party, such as by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, we may transfer or sell your personal information to the new owner. In such a case, unless permitted otherwise by applicable law, your information would remain subject to the promises made in the applicable privacy policy unless you agree differently.</p><br>
            <h6>ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION AND CHOICES</h6>
            <p>You can access and update certain information we have relating to your online account by signing into your account and going to the account home section of our Website. If you have questions about personal information we have about you or need to update your information, you can Contact Us or call us at 888-801-9075. You can opt-out of receiving marketing and promotional e-mails from CNU by clicking on the ad choices logo on the Website, and by using the opt-out or unsubscribe feature contained in the e-mails. <br>You can close your online account by paying off your balance in full and by requesting your account be closed through email, phone, U.S. mail, or live chat. If you close your account, we will no longer use your online account information or share it with third parties. We may, however, retain a copy of the information for archival purposes, and to avoid identity theft or fraud.</p>
            <h6>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h6>
            <p>We use industry standard physical, technical and administrative security measures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot guarantee, ensure, or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that e-mails and other communications you send to us through our Website are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.</p>
            <h6>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h6>
            <p>Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g. requests made in 2015 will receive information regarding 2014 sharing activities).</p><br>
            <p>To obtain this information, please send an email message to <a href="#">support@cashnetusa.com</a> with “Request for California Privacy Information” on the subject line and in the body of your message. We will provide the requested information to you at your e-mail address in response. Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light” requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.</p>
            <h6>CONSENT TO PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA IN UNITED STATES</h6>
            <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), in order to provide our Website, products and services to you, we may send and store your personal information (also commonly referred to as personal data) outside of the EEA, including to the United States. Accordingly, your personal information may be transferred outside of the country where you reside or are located, including to countries that may not or do not provide the same level of protection for your personal information. We are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information when it is transferred. Where such transfers occur, we take appropriate steps to provide the same level of protection for the processing carried out in any such countries as within the EEA to the extent feasible under applicable law. By using and accessing our Website, users who reside or are located in countries outside of the United States agree and consent to the transfer to and processing of personal information on servers located outside of the country where they reside, and that the protection of such information may be different than required under the laws of their residence or location.</p>
            <h6>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h6>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your consent in accordance with applicable law. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>

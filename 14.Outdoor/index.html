                        <p>
                            Fluffy clouds. Pillow-top beds. Marshmallows. These are just a few places our minds went when we slipped our feet into the ultra-comfy <b>HOKA ONE ONE Tor Summit Mid WP</b>, our Top Pick for Lightweight Hiker. Since joining the footwear market in 2010, <b>HOKA ONE ONE</b> has been producing running shoes with a unique approach to midsoles. They are commonly known for their extremely thick midsoles aimed to promote stability, an energetic stride, and most of all, a cushy ride. They have applied a similar strategy in their design of the <b>Tor Summit Mid</b> hikers, which translated into the most comfortable model in this review. <br>
                            <br> While it didn't take long to convince us of this product's plush properties, we were initially skeptical of how it would perform across the other scoring metrics. To our pleasant surprise, it didn't disappoint. The <b>Tor Summit Mid WP</b> also performed above-average amongst lightweight hikers in stability, traction on wet and dry rocks, and water resistance. It was even one of the most lightweight pairs to "boot" (yep, we went there). <br>
                            <br> Providing tough competition within the lightweights were the <a href="#">Keen Targhee II Mid</a> and <a href="#">Lowa Tiago GTX Mid</a>. Neither match the <b>Tor Summit</b> in terms of comfort, but depending on your needs, one might suit you better. The <b>KEEN</b> model is very affordable and provides better traction overall on a variety of surfaces. The <b>Tiago GTX Mid</b>, with a higher collar, supplies more water protection and stability.</p><br>

                        <h3 class="comfort">Comfort</h3>
                        <p> We can't express enough how great these shoes feel underfoot, even beating out the previous champs of comfort, the <a href="#">Vasque St. Elias GTX</a> and <b>Targhee II</b>. Our reviewers agreed overall that these are not only the most comfortable boots in this review, but perhaps one of the cushiest pairs they've ever worn. <b>HOKA ONE ONE</b>'s signature oversized, injection molded EVA midsole is a large source of this comfort. Even without a shank in place, we were well protected from pointy rocks underfoot by the thick layers separating our feet from the ground. Furthermore, the midsole absorbs shocks very well, which is great when jumping through obstacles and heading downhill. The Ortholite insert is also spongy, especially in the heel. This combination all but guarantees an end to sore heels and feet after a long day of hiking. Comfort is our most heavily-weighted metric, and this boot takes the cake.</p><br><br>


                        <div id="chart_Comfort"></div>


                        <p>The outsole has a rockered design that is more dynamic than the other boots in this review, without going overboard. The <b>Tiago GTX</b> also features a rockered outsole, but the <b>Tor Summit</b> seemed to pull us forward by an invisible force. This, coupled with its very light weight, makes for a very energetic boot that resists standing still. Although this could take some getting used to, we think you'll quickly learn to love this feature. </p><br><br>

                        <p>This product's lacing system consists of four lower, one middle and two upper eyelets. The flat laces slide through the eyelets well, allowing you to tighten the upper around your foot all the way down to the first eyelet with ease. The upper hooks are well-placed to snug up the supple collar around your ankles. For ease of use, we preferred lacing systems that incorporated a locking eyelet to hold the laces in place while tying the bow, such as found in the <b>Targhee II</b> and <a href="#">Salomon Quest 4D II GTX</a>, which had the best lacing system of them all.</p><br><br>

                            <span>The laces on this product, and several others, slide through the eyelets easily. This can make it tough to maintain the desired amount of tightness in different areas of the upper while tying the laces. We recommend isolating the lower, and perhaps even middle, sections of the lacing system with a friction-based Surgeon's Knot. For tips on tying this knot and more, check out our <a href="#">Buying Advice article.</a></span>
                        </div><br><br>

                        <p>The <b>Tor Summit</b> has an eVent breathable, waterproof membrane. A gusseted mesh tongue and side vents throughout the mid and forefoot section of the upper also add ventilation. We found it to be breathable enough for our needs, although we did not test it in hot summer hikes. For extreme breathability, see the aptly named <a href="#">Vasque Inhaler II GTX</a>.</p><br><br>

                        <h3 class="comfort">Stability</h3>
                        <p>This <b>HOKA ONE ONE</b> boot fell to the middle of the pack in this metric. From the footbed to the top of the ankle collar, it measured 5 inches. Somewhat making up for this fairly low height is the width of the forefoot, which tied the <a href="#">Salomon Quest 4D II GTX</a> for the second-widest measurement, strengthening the support from the base of the boot.</p><br><br>

                        <div id="chart_Stability_div"></div>

                        <p>Despite not having a midsole shank, this boot does have great torsional stability. The <a href="#">Columbia North Plains II</a> Mid was the only other hiking boot in this review without a shank built into its construction. The veritable thickness of the midsole and moderately stiff outsole prevent this model from twisting very much at all, which is especially good news if you haven't built up a lot of ankle strength. While this doesn't provide the most ankle protection of all boots in this review, we found that it was enough for most trails we encountered. Only when we went off-trail and hiked through difficult terrain did we begin to wish for more stability. If you're looking for more stability from a lightweight hiker, the <a href="#">Lowa Tiago GTX</a> is a great choice.</p> <br> <br>

                        <h3 class="comfort">Traction</h3>
                        <p>This product was one of the most trustworthy on wet rocks in our tests. The multi-directional Vibram lugs gripped slick river rocks when others slid, which gave us welcomed confidence when crossing streams and rivers. It also did well ascending and descending dry rock and slab. The <b>Tor Summit</b> submitted to the <b>Targhee II</b> in this metric, which was even better across the board in traction.</p><br><br>


                        <div id='chart_Traction_div'></div><br>

                        <p>These boots did struggle during our test laps in the scree field, and slid around more than most when slopping through mud. Lastly, the <b>HOKA ONE ONE</b> didn't take to scrambling or climbing very well, as the thick soles are too bulky and lack sensitivity. For folks seeking more purchase and climbing ability from a lightweight, head over to our Top Pick for Scrambling, the [[Asolo Jumla GV].</p><br><br>

                        <h3 class="comfort">Weight</h3>
                        <p>Weighing 2.19 lbs as pair, the <b>Tor Summit Mid WP</b> virtually tied for the second-lightest pair, being only two tenths of an ounce heavier than the <b>Inhaler II</b>. By not having a shank and utilizing a low density midsole, <b>HOKA ONE ONE</b> has created a very low weight hiker that still features a durable upper made of nubuck and suede leather (minus the mesh tongue and ankle collar). We found the combination of excellent comfort and lightweightedness made our feet and legs less tired after long days of hiking, which we valued highly.</p><br><br>


                        <div id="chart_Weight_per_Pair_Size_11_5_div"></div><br>

                        <p>If extreme lightweightedness is all you dream, there is the <b>North Plains II</b>. That said, we think the <b>HOKA ONE ONE</b>'s deliver on more levels than the <b>North Plains II</b>, making it worth the small amount of extra weight.</p><br><br>

                        </div><br>

                        <h3 class="comfort">Water Resistance</h3>
                        <p>You can stand in water up to 5 inches before it starts seeping over the eVent waterproof membrane and into the <b>Tor Summit</b>. This was far from the highest flood level we measured, yet we still found it to be enough for splashing through puddles and small streams. It withstood our five minute lake edge soak test without flinching, no matter how much we flexed the forefoot to try to force a leak.</p><br><br>

                        <div id="chart_Water_Resistance_div"></div><br>

                        <p>Instead of beading off water, the leather upper readily absorbs water after just a few uses. Although your feet won't get wet, this effectively makes these boots less attractive in cold, wet conditions. Regular application of a leather conditioner should improve this situation, though. Furthermore, when we intentionally drenched this model inside and out, it took eleven hours to completely dry them out, which was faster than the majority of the boots tested.</p><br><br>

                        <div class="photonormal">

                        <h3 class="comfort">Durability</h3><br>
                        <p>After three months of use, the only damage we could find was a small slice in the rubber of the outsole. This Vibram boot bottom is comprised of two different types of rubber - one harder in the high-impact areas of the sole, one softer in the areas receiving less shock. We assume this was a weight-saving measure, but it likely reduces the durability of the boot to a small degree. The softer rubber was where the damage was, likely caused by a sharp rock we didn't even feel. We think this part of the sole could be more susceptible to damage down the road. We liked that there were minimal seams on the upper, creating less potential points of weakness.</p><br> <br>

                        <div id="chart_Durability_div"></div><br>

                        <p>The <b>Tor Summit</b> beat out the <b>Targhee II</b> in this metric, which had more seams in areas that receive more flexing and abrasion during regular use. The most durable models we reviewed were the midweights <b>St. Elias</b> and <a href="#">Salewa Mountain Trainer Mid GTX</a>, as well as the lightweight <b>Jumla GV</b>. </p><br><br>

                        <h2>Best Applications</h2>
                        <p>We found this <b>HOKA ONE ONE</b> hiking boot to be very appropriate for easy to moderate hikes lasting from just an afternoon to multiple days, with or without a backpack. This is the terrain and distance that an average hiker will likely spend the majority of her/his time, and so we think the potential audience for this pair of boots is quite high. Until you get into very rugged terrain, water crossings, or muddy slopes, the <b>Tor Summit</b> will serve you very well. Furthermore, anyone who stands on their feet for many hours per day might be interested in this light and comfortable footwear as well. </p><br> <br>

                        <h2>Value</h2>
                        <p>Priced at $180, the <b>Tor Summit</b> presents a very valuable product. We liked it the best overall of the lightweight hikers we tested. In a world where top shelf hiking boots easily cost over $200, we think these boots are moderately priced considering their performance the key areas of comfort and weight. If you're looking to save a little money, but still grab a pair that puts performs well across the board, head over to our Best Buy award winner, the <a href="#">Keen Targhee II Mid</a>.</p><br><br>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p><b>HOKA ONE ONE</b> approached the design of the <b>Tor Summit Mid WP</b> with comfort first in mind, and scored big. While many other models seem to aim for rugged performance first and comfort later, we appreciate the focus given here. We feel that this boot will handle the vast majority of terrain that typical hikers will subject them to, and your feet, knees, and back will be thankful for the cushioned, shock absorbing footbed at the end of the day. This boot feels as light as a feather, and soft as a pillow full of them, and deserves our Top Pick for Lightweight Hiker.</p><br><br>
